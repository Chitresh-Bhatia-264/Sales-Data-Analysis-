In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis and basic forecasting on a sales dataset using Python. The tools and libraries I used include:

Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.

NumPy for numerical operations and polynomial curve fitting.

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

The project involved the following key steps:

Handling Missing Values: I replaced missing entries in the "Sales Amount" column with the mean value and addressed unknown values in categorical columns appropriately.

Date Processing: I converted the "Date" column to datetime format and set it as the index to allow for time-based analysis.

Data Cleaning: I removed duplicate entries and checked data types for each column.

Descriptive Analysis: I calculated total, average, maximum, and minimum sales, and analyzed sales by Region, Product, and Category using group-by aggregation.

Time Series Analysis: I resampled sales data by month, quarter, and week to observe patterns over time.

Moving Averages: I applied a 3-month moving average to smooth sales trends and support short-term forecasting.

Data Visualization: I created clear visualizations including line plots, histograms, bar charts, and subplots for comparative analysis.

Forecasting: I used moving averages and optional polynomial curve fitting to generate basic forecasts.
